# Aqua Security Serverless Scanner plugin for Jenkins #

Serverless functions such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions are rapidly being adopted in enterprise cloud deployments. Serverless functions present unique security and visibility challenges due to their ephemeral nature, and the way in which they are deployed on public clouds.

Jenkins users can now apply Aqua continuous function assurance to their Functions.
